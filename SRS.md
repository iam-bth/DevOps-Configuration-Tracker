## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This project is a command-line tool called **DevOps Configuration Tracker**, developed using Python. Its purpose is to allow teams to add, view, update, delete and search configuration items used in software development across **Development**, **Staging**, and **Production** environments.

### 1.2 Intended Audience
- Software Engineers
- DevOps Engineers
- Recruiters reviewing the project
- Beginners learning Python and software configuration

### 1.3 Scope
This system allows tracking of configuration items with:
- Name
- Version
- Environment (Dev, Staging, Prod)
- Status (Active, Inactive)

all data is stored in a JSON file, and the interface is entirely CLI-based for simplicity and portability.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
This is a **Standalone tool** with no external dependencies except Python standard library. It runs in the terminal and does not require any GUI or database.

### 2.2 Product Features
- Add configuration items
- View list of all config items
- Update item status
- Delete items with confirmation
- Search for items by name
- Persist data in a JSON file

### 2.3 User Characteristics
- Familiarity with using a terminal or command prompt.
- Basic understanding of configuration items in software development.

### 2.4 Constraints
- Runs in command-line only (no GUI)
- All data is stored in a local JSON file (no cloud/database)

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Python 3.x must be installed.
- User runs the program via terminal or VS Code.
